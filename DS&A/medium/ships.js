// example: 
// N = 4 => size of the 2-D board (labeled 1-4(left) A-D(top)). N is between [1..26].
// S = '1B 2C , 2D 4D' => ships positions separated by comma, 'top-left bottom-right'. 
// T = '2B 2D 3D 4D 4A' => hits positions separated by space.
// A ship can have between 1-4 cells, a ship is sunk if all her cells are hit, 
// return => '1,1' where 1st one is # of sunk ships, and 2nd one is # of hit ships.
